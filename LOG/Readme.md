* 17/07/2021 -> Continue experimenting with CNN model (Trying to get better results adding Conv2D and MaxPool2D extra layers). Continue reading ***Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow***

* 18/07/2021 -> Continue experimenting with CNN model (Colab don't let me use GPU's so... I have to wait). Watch MIT lecture about ***Convolutional Neural Network***

* 19/07/2021I'm going to start the project today -> Computer Vision (CNN)
