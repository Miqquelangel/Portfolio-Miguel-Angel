# INTRODUCTION

Hello, my name is Miguel Ángel and I'm an apassionate about the world of analitics, Machine learning and Deep learning.

I started this journey when I was first introducted to a series of videos posted on youtube. Since then I've been learning about everything I could.

Im currently doing courses online about this topics and applying the knowledge to work on my own projects.

# EDUCATION

I've completed **Bachillerato científico-tecnológico** and the **EBAU (Evaluación del Bachillerato para el Acceso a la Universidad).**

I have a **CFGS degree about telecommunications and computer systems.**

Right now I'm doing online courses in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/):

* [TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/)
* [Curso completo de Estadística descriptiva - RStudio y Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/estadistica-descriptiva/)

I'd rather go step by step. First finish this courses and then dive into more.

# HOBBIES

For me, Olympic lifting and Basketball are my gateways to free my mind when i want to have fun or stop thinking about what worries me.

And of course learning about analitics, Machine learning and Deep learning.:smile:

# GOALS

I want to make an impact and be able to solve problems, sharing knowledge with other people and create models or tools to help others to achieve great things.
